This code is based on the code at https://github.com/vivekn/sentiment and the paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6143

I have added a script that runs this Naive Bayes classifier on a 5-class problem. More information and data are available at cs.unm.edu/~aminnich. Feel free to email me with questions: aminnich@cs.unm.edu.
